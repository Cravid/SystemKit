SystemKit
=========

An OS X system library in Swift based off of
[libtop](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/top/top-100.1.2/libtop.c), from
Apple's top implementation.

For an example usage of this library, see
[dshb](https://github.com/beltex/dshb), an OS X system monitor in Swift. Also,
for OS X folks, for more system related statistics, see
[SMCKit](https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit), an Apple SMC library in Swift.
